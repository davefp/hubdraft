# HubDraft

Small app that takes content published via webhook from [Draft](http://draftin.com) and pushes it to a [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)-based git repository.

## TODO:

* Push committed code back to the remote repositiory
* Test deployment to a production environment (Heroku? VPS?)


* HTTPS support
* More intelligent repository management. Right now the repo gets nuked and re-cloned every time
